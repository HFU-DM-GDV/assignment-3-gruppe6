# Assignment #3 - Hybrid imaging

## Task
Implement a hybrid imaging application using Python and OpenCV. The application should load two images and create one hybrid image from those two. Check the [original sources](http://olivalab.mit.edu/hybridimage.htm) about the topic.
Note that you need to transform one image so that it fits optimally to the other image. You can use the transformation operations from GDV Tutorials 11-13.
Submit at least two resulting hybrid images that illustrate the effect in a nice way.
Write a short readme how to run the code and a brief explanation (max. 200 words, German or English).

## Rating
- Low and high frequency images are correctly created (1 point)
- Frequencies for separation of high and low is suitable (1 points)
- Hybrid image is combined in a suitable way that works for the given image pair ([angry_man](data\images\angry_man.png),[woman](data\images\woman.png)) (1 point)
- Image transformation so that images fit is properly implemented with a suitable user interface for manual transformation (up to 2 points)
- Nice (self-made) hybrid images are submitted (up to 2 points)
- Code is well readable, structured and documented (up to 2 points)
- Readme is well written and contains all steps to install and run the code (1 point)
- BONUS: Impressive hybrid images and/or a cool or automated user interface. (Up to 2 points)

## Acceptance criteria
- Push code (.py file) and readme.md file to the Github Classroom repository in time.
- Script runs without changes. One output image is generated.
- In the source code, it is clearly visible that the hybrid image is computed.

## Pass criteria
- The assignment is passed, if 5 or more points are reached.
